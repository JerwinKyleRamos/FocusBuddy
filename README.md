# FocusBuddy
FocusBuddy is a Python-based eye-tracking application designed to help users stay focused on their tasks and minimize distractions.

# ABOUT
FocusBuddy leverages MediaPipe's Face Mesh to accurately detect facial landmarks and track eye gaze in real time.  
The application monitors whether the user is looking at the screen, and if they look away for too long, it triggers an alarm to gently remind them to refocus.  
This tool is ideal for anyone looking to improve productivity, maintain attention, and reduce procrastination.
